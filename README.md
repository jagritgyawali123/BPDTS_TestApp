# BPDTS_TestApp
BPDTS_TestApp API Tests 
The tests have been written using Groovy scripting in SoapUI.
Please note that the following two tests are currently failing and will need some validation rules created to fix the issue.

GET /city/{city}/users_Integer

GET /city/{city}/users_NonExistentCity


I have also included the link to download SoapUI to run the tests.
